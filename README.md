# Archive Notice

Update: We are in the process of transfering ownership to a new team who will maintain the project moving forward. Appreciate everyone's patience during the transition. 

~Due to organizational changes we are no longer able to maintain this code. To ensure the project status is clear we have taken the difficult decision to archive this repository. The current release along with source code will remain available. We understand this is disruptive to current IdFix users. If you find the tool valuable and would like to see it continue please us [UserVoice](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/169401-azure-active-directory) to express the need. You may also find the [AADConnect tool](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=47594) of use for similar scenarios.~


# IdFix : Directory Synchronization Error Remediation Tool

IdFix is used to perform discovery and remediation of identity objects and their attributes in an on-premises Active Directory environment in preparation for migration to Azure Active Directory. IdFix is intended for the Active Directory administrators responsible for directory synchronization with Azure Active Directory.

The purpose of IdFix is to reduce the time involved in remediating the Active Directory errors reported by Azure AD Connect. Our focus is on enabling the customer to accomplish the task in a simple expedient fashion without relying upon subject matter experts. 

The Microsoft Office 365 IdFix tool provides the customer with the ability to identify and remediate object errors in their Active Directory in preparation for deployment to Azure Active Directory or Office 365. They will then be able to successfully synchronize users, contacts, and groups from the on-premises Active Directory into Azure Active Directory.
