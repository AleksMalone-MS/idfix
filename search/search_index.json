A portion of this effort is intended to address the time involved in remediating the Active Directory errors reported by the directory synchronization tools. The focus of IdFix is to enable the customer to accomplish this task in a simple, expedient fashion without relying on subject matter experts. To date, processes used to remediated Active Directory issues in customer environments have been inconsistent at best. Each customer has relied upon interpretations of the guidance, expensive consulting, and the varied skill sets they have local to their organizations. The result has been long delays in correcting errors with corresponding delays in deployment and associated customer dissatisfaction. Microsoft has recognized that customers need a basic tool to alleviate this pain. IdFix provides customers the ability to identify and remediate the majority of object synchronization errors in their Active Directory forests in preparation for deployment to Office 365. Analysis from the Support cases per month shows that roughly 60% of all errors seen daily fall into duplicate or malformed proxyAddresses and userPrincipalName. The utility does not fix all errors, but it does find and fix the majority. This remediation will then allow them to more successfully synchronize users, contacts, and groups from the on-premises Active Directory into the Microsoft 365. IdFix may identify errors beyond those that emerge during synchronization. The most common example is compliance with rfc 2822 for smtp addresses. Although invalid attribute values can be synchronized to the cloud the best practice recommendation from the product group is that these errors be corrected.","title":"Home"},{"location":"build-docs/","text":"Building the Documentation \u00b6 Building the documentation locally can help you visualize change you are making to the docs.

We also happily accept pull requests containing new functionality or fixes. Performance \u00b6 IdFix performance will vary based on the hardware utilized and the network latency to the Active Directory global catalog (GC) server. Machines should have the minimum RAM specified and will benefit by using faster hard drives since temporary files are written to disk during the AD Query. High latency connections to a DC are discouraged and the best performance will be experienced by running the application on a DC. Number of errors shown \u00b6 Customers with more than 50,000 errors returned faced the possibility of exceeding physical memory in attempting to display all data at one time. To alleviate this issue, errors are broken into blocks of 50,000. Exceeding the block size enables the More Errors options of View Next Block and View Previous Block. Temporary files \u00b6 Large volumes of data may be parsed in the search for duplicate values. For instance a user may have up to six (6) attributes that must be checked and the proxyAddresses field can have many values. The duplicate check count may routinely exceed five (5) times the number of objects returned. For this reason, data must be written to disk to avoid the out of memory exception on most workstations. Do not delete the temporary files while running. This will trigger an exception and may cause unpredictable results. Directory Exceptions \u00b6 There are 60 separate LDAP return codes and four (4) types of directory exceptions that can occur when contacting a directory server. These should be gracefully handled with a message box and an error written to the log. Client-server timeout is one example where the condition may be sporadic. To alleviate this issue, the default LDAP timeout interval has been increased from 30 seconds to two (2) minutes. This is a server side limitation, and the application respects all server side limits. If this should occur, then wait for a period of time when the GC is not so heavily utilized and/or launch the application from a lower latency location. For example, directly on a global catalog server. Don\u2019t see updates in other domains \u00b6 If the response to an update was COMPLETE, then the value has been applied to the directory. However, you may need to wait for replication to complete. Attempting to apply the update multiple times in a row may result in an exception stating the server is unwilling to process the request. Run Query AD again and you should observe the error has been resolved. FAIL (ACTION) \u00b6 Extensive efforts have been made to make the schema and value limits of the Active Directory unobtrusive. With that caveat, it is still possible for the value entered in the UPDATE column to conflict with a directory rule within AD. If the ACTION value on a row turns to FAIL then there is an unknown conflict between the UPDATE column and the attribute values stored in the directory. These conflicts will require that the attribute values currently stored be examined more closely and may require ADSIEDIT in order to resolve. Double Byte Characters \u00b6 IdFix has not been localized and double byte characters have not been tested in the application. Please send any errors of this type to IdFixSupport@Microsoft.com for further investigation. Filtering \u00b6 The application allows the user to specify a directory branch to use to begin the subtree search for errors. Multiple subtrees are not supported and the start point will be used by the Query function until changed in the Filter Subtree dialog. Filtering of values within the column is not supported as they can already be sorted. Selecting Import to use a manually edited file will reset the filter to the whole forest for the Query option. Sorting \u00b6 The data columns can be sorted by clicking on the column header as is standard in dataGridView UX behavior. Clicking again will reverse the sort. Export Data \u00b6 Exporting of data is facilitated via the Export icon. Import Data \u00b6 The ability to Import a CSV file is now supported. This feature is a use at your own risk option. While we\u2019ve created error and format handling functions in order to help populate the datagrid correctly there is no way to insure that incorrect errors are not introduced by manually editing the file.

Directory synchronization rule sets are different depending on which version of Office 365 is in use. The Settings icon allows you to choose between running the Multi-Tenant or Dedicated/ITAR rule sets in order to detect attribute values known to cause directory synchronization errors relevant to the version of Office 365 in use. The scope of the query can be limited by selecting the Filter icon and entering a valid directory path to use as a start for the subtree search. Only one starting point can be designated at a time. The subtree point will be used for all successive queries until changed. Deleting the value will reset the query to the whole forest. The value must be entered in the format OU=myOu,DC=Contoso,DC=com in order to function. Query for relevant directory synchronization errors. IdFix queries all objects with a filter for applicable attributes. IdFix updates the status line on the bottom of the dataGridView and writes all values to the log. Cancel terminates a running query if the user does not wish to continue. IdFix applies rules against the required AD attributes to determine which objects must be remediated and presents you with any detected error conditions. IdFix displays items with information related to the object in question and the error conditions. Objects are identified by the distinguishedName with the associated error type and value that is in error. Where feasible, IdFix presents a recommendation for corrective data in the UPDATE column. Recommendations are based on a \u201cbest effort\u201d approach for the specific object in question. Since recommendations are object specific, they are not checked against the existing data set and may introduce additional errors. For certain types of errors (duplicates and format errors), a recommendation for correction is NOT provided. Corrective information must be manually entered to correct the issue. In the event multiple errors are associated with a single attribute, errors are combined into a single line item. If a blank datagrid is displayed after execution, then no errors were returned. This is a good thing. To correct the object attribute values, select one of the following ACTION options from the drop down list: ||| |-|-| |COMPLETE|The original value is acceptable and should not be changed despite being identified as being in an error state. For example, two users may have a proxyAddress identified as duplicate. Only one can use the value for mail delivery. The user with the correct value should be marked as COMPLETE, while the other user is marked as REMOVE.| |REMOVE|The attribute value will be cleared from the source object. In the case of a multi-valued attribute; e.g. proxyAddresses, only the individual value shown will be cleared.| |EDIT|The information in the UPDATE column will be used to modify the attribute value for the selected object. In many cases, a valid update value has been predetermined. In these cases, you can mark the ACTION as EDIT and go on to the next error. If the predetermined update value is not desired, you can manually input the new value.| |UNDO|This value is only shown if the user has loaded a previously saved Update file. The sole operation that can be executed is to restore the original value.| |FAIL|This value is only shown if an update value has an unknown conflict with the directory rules. In this case, you may attempt to edit the value again. It may be necessary to analyze the values in the object using ADSIEDIT.| Only errors with a customer selected Action will be considered for update. To reiterate; unless a specific choice is made IdFix will not perform any operation on the error. The option to Accept all suggested updates is available. After selecting the ACTION for one or more errors, choose the Apply menu item to write the values to Active Directory.

Error Explanations \u00b6 For details on the errors that apply to each attribute see the Supported Errors section in the Appendix. Character The Value contains a character which is invalid. The suggested Update will show the value with the character removed. Format The Value violates the format requirements for the attribute usage. The suggested Update will show the Value with any invalid characters removed. If there are no invalid characters the Update and Value will appear the same. It is up to the user to determine what they really want in the Update. For example SMTP addresses must comply with rfc 2822 and mailNickName cannot start or end with a period. TopLevelDomain This applies to values subject to rfc2822 formatting. If the top level domain is not internet routable then this will be identified as an error. For example a smtp address ending in .local is not internet routable and would cause this error. DomainPart This applies to values subject to rfc2822 formatting. If the domain portion of the value is invalid beyond the top level domain routing this will be generated. LocalPart This applies to values subject to rfc2822 formatting. If the local portion of the value is invalid this will be generated. Length The Value violates the length limit for the attribute. This is most commonly encountered when the schema has been altered. The suggested Update will truncate the value to the attribute standard length. Duplicate The Value has a duplicate within the scope of the query. All duplicate values will be displayed as errors. The user can Edit or Remove values to eliminate duplication. Blank The Value violates the null restriction for attributes to be synchronized. Only a few values must contain a value. The suggested Update will leverage other attribute values in order to generate a likely substitute. MailMatch This applies to Dedicated only. The Value does not match the mail attribute.

For example SMTP addresses must comply with rfc 2822 and mailNickName cannot start or end with a period. TopLevelDomain This applies to values subject to rfc2822 formatting. If the top level domain is not internet routable then this will be identified as an error. For example a smtp address ending in .local is not internet routable and would cause this error. DomainPart This applies to values subject to rfc2822 formatting. If the domain portion of the value is invalid beyond the top level domain routing this will be generated. LocalPart This applies to values subject to rfc2822 formatting. If the local portion of the value is invalid this will be generated. Length The Value violates the length limit for the attribute. This is most commonly encountered when the schema has been altered. The suggested Update will truncate the value to the attribute standard length. Duplicate The Value has a duplicate within the scope of the query. All duplicate values will be displayed as errors. The user can Edit or Remove values to eliminate duplication. Blank The Value violates the null restriction for attributes to be synchronized. Only a few values must contain a value. The suggested Update will leverage other attribute values in order to generate a likely substitute. MailMatch This applies to Dedicated only. The Value does not match the mail attribute. The suggested Update will be the mail attribute value prefixed by \u201cSMTP:\u201d.","title":"Error Explanations"},{"location":"preperation/","text":"Preparation \u00b6 Depending on the number of objects in the on-premises Active Directory, there may be a large number of objects to synchronize. Even a low failure rate can result in a large number of objects that must be manually corrected. This can significantly delay a deployment and increase project expense. The remediation effort is focused on directory synchronization errors which may be raised even if the on-premises environment seems to be operating normally. Remember that the directory synchronization tools check for values that could potentially cause issues with cloud services that may not cause issues in the on-premises environment. Functionality \u00b6 The Administrator using the tool should understand the implications of modifying directory objects and attributes. IdFix queries all domains in the currently authenticated forest and displays object attribute values which would be reported as errors by the supported directory synchronization tool. The datagrid supports the ability to scroll, sort, and edit those objects in a resulting table to produce compliant values. Confirmed values can then be applied to the forest with the ability to undo updates. Transaction rollback is supported. In the case of invalid characters, a suggested \u201cfix\u201d is displayed where it can be determined from the existing value. Changes are applied only to records for which the customer has set an ACTION value. Customer confirmation of each change is enforced. Suggested values for formatting errors start with the removal of invalid characters and then the value must be updated by the user. It is beyond the scope of this utility to determine what the user really wanted when a mistake in formatting is detected. Not all objects should be made available for editing as some could cause harm to the source environment; e.g. critical system objects. These objects are excluded from the IdFix datagrid. Well Known Exclusions as defined by the Deployment Guide are supported. Data can be exported into CSV or LDF format for offline editing or investigation. Save to File is supported. Import of CSV is supported. There are caveats with this feature. The function relies upon the distinguishedName and attribute to determine the value to update. The best way to do this is to export from a query and change the Update. Keep the other columns as they were and do not introduce escape characters into the values. Since IdFix makes changes in the customer environment, logging is included. Verbose logging is enabled by default. Support for both Multi-Tenant and Dedicated versions of Office 365 are enabled in this release. The rule sets are selected via the Settings icon on the menu. Requirements \u00b6 Hardware Requirements \u00b6 A physical or virtual machine is required in order to run IdFix. The computer should meet the following specifications: - 4 GB ram (minimum) - 2 GB of hard disk space (minimum) Software Requirements \u00b6 Software Description Operating System The application has been tested on Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows 7 for x64 bit versions .NET Framework 4.0 .NET Framework 4.0 or higher must be installed on the workstation running the application. Active Directory Queries are via native LDAP and have been tested with Windows Server 2008 R2, but all versions should be expected to work. Exchange Server The messaging attributes retrieved are version independent and should work with Exchange 2003 or newer. Permissions The application runs in the context of the authenticated user which means that it will query the authenticated forest and must have rights to read the directory. If you wish to apply changes to the directory the authenticated user needs write permission to the desired objects. Note that IdFix does not need to be installed on the Exchange or Active Directory server. It merely needs to be installed on a workstation in the forest and have access to a Global Catalog server. Identity Management Systems Conflicts \u00b6 It is important that any identity management system in the on-premises Active Directory environment be evaluated to determine if it creates any conflicts with IdFix. The risk is after correcting an error, an on-premises identity management system may update the attribute again, returning it to its original error state. Before implementing directory synchronization, it may be necessary to review or modify portions of existing identity management systems if they are repeatedly generating invalid attribute values. Active Directory Impacts \u00b6 This section describes the updates that may be applied to attributes in the customer's on-premises Active Directory environment.
